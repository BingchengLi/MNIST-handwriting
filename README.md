# MNIST-handwriting
My first machine learning project (created in Dec 2021). I developed a MNIST Handwritten digit classifier using a convolutional neural network(CNN).

## Dataset
I trained the classifer using the [MNIST Dataset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNIST_database), which is a large database of handwritten digits that is commonly used for training various image processing systems.

## Demo
The model was not trained particularly well since I didn't know that much about machine learning back then, but you can play around with it by visiting [this website](https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/bingchel/handwriting.html).
